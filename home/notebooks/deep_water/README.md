# H2O Deep Learning Jupyter Notebooks

## DeepWater

These notebooks assume that you have the DeepWater version of H2O.
If your don't have it, you can follow the instructions of our [deepwater](https://github.com/h2oai/deepwater) repository.

Note: There are many more example scripts in:
 - [h2o-py/tests](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-py/tests)
 - [h2o-py/demos](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-py/demos)
 - [h2o-r/tests](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/tests)
 - [h2o-r/demos](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/demos)

The examples assume that you run jupyter notebook from the same directory:

```bash
cd examples/deeplearning/notebooks/
jupyter notebook .
```
